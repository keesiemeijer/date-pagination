Paginate your posts by year, month or day.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/keesiemeijer/date-pagination.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/keesiemeijer/date-pagination)

Version:           2.1.0-alpha  
Requires at least: 4.5  
Tested up to:      5.5  

This is the development repository for the WordPress plugin [Date Pagination](https://wordpress.org/plugins/date-pagination/).

This plugin provides an easy way to paginate posts by year, month or day in your theme’s template files. Use the native [WordPress pagination functions](https://keesiemeijer.wordpress.com/date-pagination/functions/#wp-pagination-functions) to display the pagination links.

It’s likely your theme is already using these functions for normal pagination. If not, see if it works with your theme’s pagination or add them yourself.

To tell WordPress a page should be paginated by dates set the `date_pagination_type` query argument to `yearly`, `monthly` or `daily` for a custom query ([WP_Query](http://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/WP_Query)), or in the [pre_get_posts](https://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API/Action_Reference/pre_get_posts) action.

See [the plugin documentation](https://keesiemeijer.wordpress.com/date-pagination/) for examples and more information on how to use this plugin in your theme.

***Note***: This plugin intentionally doesn't do pagination for date archives. See [this plugin](https://github.com/keesiemeijer/date-archives-pagination) to do just that.

### Development ###
The `master` branch is where you'll find the most recent, stable release.
The `develop` branch is the current working branch for development. Both branches are required to pass all unit tests. Any pull requests are first merged with the `develop` branch before being merged into the `master` branch. See [Pull Requests](https://github.com/keesiemeijer/date-pagination/tree/master#pull-requests)
